# LifeExperiment (iOS)

A long-term personal project to build a lightweight "life experiment" tracker.
This repo documents my daily progress as both a product + engineering practice.

## What this app is
- A minimal tracker for daily life experiments (small actions, reflections, learnings)
- Built with SwiftUI
- Focus: clarity > complexity, shipping > perfection

## Daily workflow
Each day I do:
1) Write a 4-line skeleton (what / friction / learning / next action)
2) Implement one small UI + state change in SwiftUI
3) Commit & push to GitHub (one snapshot per day)

## Progress log
- Day 7: Button + @State, first end-to-end change visible in Simulator
- Day 8: (planned) add basic model + one more state-driven UI change

## Principles
- Small steps, daily compounding
- State-driven UI (SwiftUI mental model)
- Reduce unknowns, one friction at a time

## Tech
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- Git + GitHub
